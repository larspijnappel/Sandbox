This code loads the required packages:
 
```{r}
library(igraph)
# library(dplyr)
library(printr)
```

>> Error msg when loading ```dplyr```.

This code generates a random directed graph with 10 objects:
 
```{r}
g <- random.graph.game(n = 10, p.or.m = 1/4, directed = TRUE)
```

Here's what the graph looks like:
 
```{r}
plot(g)
```

This code calculates the PageRank for each object:
 
```{r}
pr <- page.rank(g)$vector
```

This code outputs the PageRank for each object:
 
```{r}
 df <- data.frame(Object = 1:10, PageRank = pr)
# arrange(df, desc(PageRank))
```
